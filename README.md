# 🚀 AI-Driven Fault-Tolerant Distributed Task Engine  
### Self-Learning AI with Energy Optimization on AMD Multi-Core Architecture  

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an AI-driven distributed task engine that proactively predicts node failures, dynamically balances workloads, and optimizes energy utilization using AMD multi-core architecture.

Unlike traditional reactive schedulers, this system uses a self-learning AI model to predict instability before failures occur and intelligently reroutes tasks to maintain high reliability and performance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern distributed systems suffer from reactive failure handling, inefficient load balancing, high energy consumption, and poor multi-core utilization.  

This project aims to design an intelligent system that predicts failures in advance, distributes tasks dynamically, and optimizes performance-per-watt on AMD multi-core processors.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Tasks are generated and received via API.
2. Node metrics (CPU, memory, queue length) are collected.
3. AI model predicts future load and failure probability.
4. Smart scheduler assigns tasks to optimal nodes.
5. If instability is detected, graph-based rerouting is triggered.
6. Tasks are reassigned until successful completion.
